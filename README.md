# GitPoem
This is a poem about Git tut from TheCodingTrain

##Here, you can go to RainbowPoem>Insights>Network and watch how RainbowPoem  got modified,branches were created and merged with pull request.

1.First I created a new file "RainbowPoem" and added color green there.

2.Then, I created a branch **Unicorn** but then again merged it with the main/master branch with pull request.

3.Later, I created another branch **"Ponies"** and made some changes in both master/main branch as well as Ponies so I encouncterd my first **Merge Conflict**.
I resolved it and merged Ponies with master.
